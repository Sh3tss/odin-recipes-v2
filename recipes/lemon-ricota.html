<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>These no-bake lemon ricotta cheesecake bars get an extra creamy boost from the addition of ricotta cheese. Make sure to take the time to drain the ricotta before adding it to the filling. The pistachios in the crust and garnish, are optional; but totally recommended. You can use almonds, or simply use more graham cracker crumbs instead.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<h3>Crust</h3>
<ul>
<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 pinch salt</li>
<li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1 1/3 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs (from about 9 crackers)</li>
<li>1/2 cup finely chopped roasted, unsalted pistachios</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoon almond extract</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups whole milk ricotta cheese, drained</li>
<li>16 ounces full-fat cream cheese, softened</li>
<li>1 cup confectioners sugar, or to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest</li>
<li>3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 pinch salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped roasted, unsalted pistachios (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place ricotta into a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl. Allow to drain for at least 1 hour before using.</li>
<li>Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
<li>For crust, combine butter, brown sugar, salt, and nutmeg in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stopping to stir after every 30-second interval, until mixture begins to foam and bubble, and sugar is mostly dissolved; about 2 minutes. Stir in graham cracker crumbs, pistachios, and almond extract until evenly moistened. </li>
<li>Press crust mixture very firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Freeze crust until chilled and set, about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>For filling, combine drained ricotta and cream cheese in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and combined. Add in confectioner’s sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt and beat on medium speed until smooth and combined.</li>
<li>Remove crust from freezer. Pour filling over crust and smooth into an even layer. Return pan to the freezer and chill until filling is set, at least 3 hours.</li>
<li>To cut bars, remove from the pan using the parchment overhang, and place onto a cutting board. Run a sharp knife under hot water for several seconds, then wipe it dry. Cut bars with the hot knife, wiping it off between each cut and running it under hot water and drying again as needed. Sprinkle bars with chopped pistachios before serving.</li>
<li>Keep bars stored in the freezer, but allow to sit at room temperature to soften for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
